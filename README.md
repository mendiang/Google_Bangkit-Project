Project and assignment from Google Bangkit \n
This project about how to classified the mnist_fashion data set according to their label using Recurrent Neural Network Technique. 
Eventhough this problem usually using Convolutional Neural Network, Our team try to build with another supervised deep neural network to see if its result better or not.
